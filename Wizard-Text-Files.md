To fully customize your wizard's features, there are a number of text files you should create and format with your own data. These files must be hosted, and the URLs to each file can be added into `uservar.py`. The only one Required to get your own builds to install is builds.txt . The rest are for additional Features .  

_**Pay Close Attention to the format of the *.txt files . Do NOT remove any lines , if you wish not to use a feature of a text file just leave the line with  "http://"**_

Examples of what can be done with these text files can be found on the following pages:

* addons.txt     [[Installing Add-ons]]
* advanced.txt   [[Packaging advancedsettings.xml Files]]
* apks.txt       [[Installing .apk's]]
* builds.txt     [[Installing Builds]]
* notify.txt     [[Update Notifications]]
* themes.txt     [[Packaging Themes for Builds]]
* youtube.txt    [[Including a YouTube Video Section]]
