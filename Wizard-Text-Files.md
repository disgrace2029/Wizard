To fully customize your wizard's features, there are a number of text files you should create and format with your own data. These files must be hosted, and the URLs to each file can be added into `uservar.py`.

Examples of what can be done with these text files can be found on the following pages:

* addons.txt   [[Installing Add-ons]]
* advanced.txt [[Packaging advancedsettings.xml Files]]
* apks.txt     [[Installing .apk's]]
* builds.txt   [[Installing Builds]]
* notify.txt   [[Update Notifications]]
* themes.txt   [[Packaging Themes for Builds]]
* youtube.txt  [[Including a YouTube Video Section]]
