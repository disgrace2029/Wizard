To fully customize your wizard's features, there are a number of text files you should create and format with your own data. These files must be hosted, and the URLs to each file can be added into `uservar.py`. The only one required to get your own builds to install is `builds.txt`. The rest are for additional wizard features.  

**Pay close attention to the format of the `.txt` files. Do NOT remove any lines, or you will break your wizard.**

Examples of what can be done with these text files can be found on the following pages:

* addons.txt - [[Installing Add-ons]]
* advanced.txt - [[Packaging advancedsettings.xml Files]]
* apks.txt - [[Installing .apk's]]
* builds.txt - [[Installing Builds]]
* notify.txt - [[Update Notifications]]
* themes.txt - [[Packaging Themes for Builds]]
* youtube.txt - [[Including a YouTube Video Section]]
