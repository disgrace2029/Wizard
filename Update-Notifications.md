This file is used to notify when new builds, or other changes, are available, and is typically named `notify.txt`.

This file is formatted differently than the rest:

```
1
|||

Your message here
```

Simply increment the number any time you want to send a new notification to users, and change the message accordingly. **Do not** modify the '|||' line.
